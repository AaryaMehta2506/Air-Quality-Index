# Air-Quality-Index
Air Quality Index (AQI) has emerged as a valuable tool for measuring and reporting air quality levels. The AQI serves as a standardized metric, providing an accessible and easily understandable assessment of air quality conditions to the public and policymakers. This project aims to develop an AQI system by utilizing data science methodologies.
