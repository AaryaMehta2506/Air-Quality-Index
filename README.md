Air Quality Index (AQI) has emerged as a valuable tool for measuring and reporting air quality levels. The AQI serves as a standardized metric, providing an accessible and easily understandable assessment of air quality conditions to the public and policymakers. This project aims to develop an AQI system by utilizing data science methodologies.
By collecting and analyzing various air quality parameters, including pollutants such as particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), the project assesses the overall air quality status. These parameters are obtained from reliable monitoring stations strategically placed across different locations.
The resulting AQI provides a numerical value that corresponds to a specific air quality category, ranging from good to hazardous, enabling individuals and authorities to quickly understand the severity of the air pollution situation. The project's objectives include designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface to display the real-time AQI values and provide historical trends for different locations. Moreover, the system aims to generate informative visualizations and alerts to promote public awareness and inform policy decisions.
By developing and implementing this AQI project, it becomes possible to monitor and evaluate air quality conditions comprehensively. The project's outcomes contribute to public health, enabling individuals to make informed decisions about outdoor activities and taking appropriate measures to protect themselves during periods of poor air quality. Additionally, policymakers can use the AQI data to implement effective pollution control measures and formulate targeted strategies for air quality improvement.
